# Momentum, Volatility, and Volume Factors in U.S. Stock Returns

**ISYE 4031 Final Project**  
*Industrial & Systems Engineering, Georgia Tech*

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between momentum, volatility, and volume factors in U.S. stock returns using S&P 500 data. We investigate how these three key market indicators influence stock performance and develop predictive models for return forecasting.

## Research Questions

- How do Momentum, Volatility, and Volume factors preduct future stock returns?

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- **Source**: S&P 500 companies via Yahoo Finance API
- **Time Period**: 2021-2024 (4 years of daily data)

### Analysis Framework
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare financial time series data
2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculate momentum, volatility, and volume indicators
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize relationships between factors
4. **Statistical Modeling**: Linear and non-linear regression analysis
5. **Model Validation**: Cross-validation and out-of-sample testing

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Financial Data**: yfinance, pandas-datareader
- **Analysis**: scikit-learn, statsmodels
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

## Expected Deliverables

- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive statistical analysis of factor relationships
- **Predictive Models**: Regression models with performance metrics
- **Visualizations**: Charts and plots showing factor correlations and trends
- **Research Findings**: Statistical significance tests and economic interpretations
- **Final Report**: Summary of methodology, results, and conclusions
